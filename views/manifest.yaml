  Allows to create SQL views based on other SQL queries.

  This simplifies many tasks, and can speed queries, as results are briefly
  cached.

  For example if usually it is required to navigate some tables to get the
  category of a post in a wordpress database, a `postcategory` table
  can be created that do the necessary navigation and leave a cleaner query.

  For materialized views check the `Databox` package.
