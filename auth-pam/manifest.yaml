description: |
  Allows to access serverboards using PAM, enabling use of many technologies
  to be used for login.

  Users try to log in the `serverboards` service.

  When new users try to login and they do not exist a proper user is created
  with the user name.

  If any of the groups of the user matches the name of a group in Serverboards,
  it is added to such group. This is checked and modified on every login.

  If any group starts with `serverboards-`, it will be added as well, without
  the initial `serverboards-`. For example `serverboards-admin` will be added as
  `admin`.
